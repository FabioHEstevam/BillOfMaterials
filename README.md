# Bill of Materials

## Created by *Fábio Henrique Estevam*

This is a project I am developing to serve as both a portfolio sample and a way to enhance my programming skills.
It allows me to apply my knowledge across different domains and combine various technologies to solve a specific problem.

## Problem Definition:

In engineering projects, material management is a critical stage that directly impacts the efficiency, costs, and execution of the project. The creation of detailed and well-organized material lists is essential to meet the needs of different sectors involved in the process.

- **For estimators**: it is necessary to calculate the project’s estimated costs based on the required materials and quantities, ensuring that the budget aligns with financial objectives.

- **For procurement teams**: the lists must provide clear and accurate information about the required materials, their specifications, quantities, and potential suppliers, facilitating efficient negotiations and purchases.

- **For builders**: the lists act as a guide to ensure that all necessary items are available on-site, avoiding delays and interruptions during project execution.

Poorly organized or incomplete material lists can lead to issues such as rework, resource waste, budgeting errors, and project delivery delays. 
Additionally, a lack of integration between different project sectors can hinder collaboration and compromise overall efficiency.

This system proposes a technological solution to centralize, organize, and simplify the creation and management of material lists, ensuring greater accuracy and improved communication across the sectors involved.
